        SECURE DATA TRANSMISSION
    </marquee>

    <p class="intro-para">Secure data transmission is imperative to privacy and protection from cyber and identity
        theft. This step ensures that the users' data travels through a secure environment that is
        resistant to penetration and hacking. </p>
    <h3 class="heading1">Following techniques may be applied to ensure secure transmission of data via the Internet:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORISATION:</li>
        <p> Authentication is the basis of access control nd Authentieation then selling that
            information to people
            her/his identity has to be verified. This is called authentication. </p>
            <li>Intrusion Detection System:</li>
            <p> An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) checks all network movement and entifies doubtful patterns that 
                may indicate a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into a system, for ex:- Firewall</p>
            <li>Encryption:</li>
            <p>Any confidential data needs to be transferred over a secured
                channel. It needs to be encryoted or coded before being transmitted. Encryption is the process of transforming data into an unreadable code</p>  
               <li>HTTPS PROTOCOL: </li>   
               <p> This encrypts the information or data using Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate or formally
                Predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The certificate creates an encrypted connection between the server
                and the browser to ensure secured transfer of information from the server to the browser. </p>
                <li>PASSWORD AND PIN NUMBERS:</li>
                <p>Never share your password and PIN number with unauthorised personnel, under
                    any circumstances.</p>
