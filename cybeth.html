        Cyberethics for E-Commerce
    </marquee>
    <br>
    <p class="intro-para">The Internet has significantly changed the way of conducting business all over
        the world. E-Commerce stands for Electronic Commerce, which refers to the
        transaction of goods and services online, using the Internet. The Internet offers
        us convenient ways to shop from our homes or offices for almost everything. We
        can buy or sell new, as well as second-hand goods. </p>

       Fraud
    </marquee>
    <p class="intro-para">Failure to practice ethical code of conduct constitutes fraud. Fraud means purposefully
        misrepresenting facts to
        deceive another person for personal gains. The said gain may be in the form of money, goods, or information.</p>

    <h2 class="heading1">Reasons for Increase in Online Frauds</h2>
    <ul class="list">   <li>Ambiguity:</li>
        <p>Since the transaction does not happen face-to-face, the identity of the parties is easily conceal and is hard
            to verify.</p>

        <li>Legal loophole: </li>
        <p>The law has been unable to keep up with online crime. It is reletively difficult to track, to identify, and
            prove the crime and identify the criminal.</p>

        <li>Hacking: </li>
        <p> It is relatively easy for hackers to steal information and fraudsters to buy that information in the online
            black market. </p>

        <h2 class="heading1">Types of E-commerce Frauds</h2>

        <li>Selling counterfeit products:</li>
        <p>Some sellers may utilise third party uppliers, dropshipping, and ship stolen or refurbished goods</p>

        <li>Unfriendly Return Policy: </li>
        <p>Some sellers include No-refund, No-return, or As-is clause
            fine print that prevents buyers from obtaining a refund or exchange for defected or
            unsuitable items.</p>

        <li>Fraudulent payment: </li>
        <p> These are the payments made using stolen credit cards or bank
            account information. </p>
    </ul>
